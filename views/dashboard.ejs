                    Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion
                    photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most
                    desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia
                    shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something
                    far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The
                    price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and
                    spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with
                    Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband
                    takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to
                    consume him..

                    A gripping novel about the whirlwind rise of an iconic 1970s rock group and their beautiful lead
                    singer, revealing the mystery behind their infamous breakup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip,
                    sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are
                    thrilling, but it’s the rock ’n’ roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting
                    noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things. Also getting
                    noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the eve of their first tour, his
                    girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame,
                    Billy goes a little wild on the road. Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the
                    key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of
                    legend. The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as
                    an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies.

                    You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.

                    The first lesson is to make yourself strong.

                <p>
                    After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her younger brother
                    safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the
                    throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough
                    if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her
                    even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own
                    life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own
                    complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.
